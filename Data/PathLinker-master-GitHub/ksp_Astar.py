    # to it (at that point it gets added to the dist[] dict. A node is SEEN

    # The A* algorithm for monotonic heuristic functions is very similar to
    # Dijkstra's algorithm. The difference is that we key the heap by the
    # distance to the node PLUS the heuristic function, which gives a lower
    # bound on the length of the path the rest of the way to the target.

    # This algorithm follows the convention that if the value of the
    # heuristic is float('inf'), this corresponds to being unreachble.
    # That is, the node is disconnected from the target according the
    # heuristic. This means that float('inf') cannot be used as a valid
    # edge weight, and heuristic functions must conform.
